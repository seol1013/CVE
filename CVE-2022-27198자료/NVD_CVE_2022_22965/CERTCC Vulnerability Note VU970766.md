## Spring Framework insecurely handles PropertyDescriptor objects with data binding

#### Vulnerability Note VU#970766

Original Release Date: 2022-03-31 | Last Revised: 2022-05-19

---

### Overview

The Spring Framework insecurely handles PropertyDescriptor objects, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) is a Java framework that can be used to create applications such as web applications. Due to improper handling of PropertyDescriptor objects used with data binding, Java applications written with Spring may allow for the execution of arbitrary code.

Exploit code that targets affected WAR-packaged Java code for tomcat servers is publicly available.

NCSC-NL has a [list of products and their statuses](https://github.com/NCSC-NL/spring4shell/blob/main/software/README.md) with respect to this vulnerability.

### Impact

By providing crafted data to a Spring Java application, such as a web application, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application. Depending on the application, exploitation may be possible by a remote attacker without requiring authentication.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

This issue is addressed in Spring Framework 5.3.18 and 5.2.20. Please see the [Spring Framework RCE Early Announcement](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement) for more details.
